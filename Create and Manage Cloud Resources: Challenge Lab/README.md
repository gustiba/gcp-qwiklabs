# [Create and Manage Cloud Resources: Challenge Lab](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10258?parent=catalog)

## Overview
You must complete a series of tasks within the allocated time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and a set of tasks: you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

## Challenge scenario
You have started a new role as a Junior Cloud Engineer for Jooli, Inc. You are expected to help manage the infrastructure at Jooli. Common tasks include provisioning resources for projects.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so step-by-step guides are not provided.

Some Jooli, Inc. standards you should follow:
1. Create all resources in the default region or zone, unless otherwise directed.
2. Naming normally uses the format team-resource; for example, an instance could be named **nucleus-webserver1**.
3. Allocate cost-effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored, and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so plan carefully. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share: unless directed, use **f1-micro** for small Linux VMs, and use **n1-standard-1** for Windows or other applications, such as Kubernetes nodes.
